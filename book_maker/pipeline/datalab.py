"""Datalab Convert, as a small adapter around one paid submission.

The whole reason this file is careful is that a submission costs money per
book. So:

* the job handle is written to disk the moment it exists, before the first
  poll, and a later run polls that handle instead of submitting again;
* a submission whose outcome is not known -- the connection died, or a 200
  came back without a job handle in it -- leaves a marker and refuses to
  resubmit until a person has checked the provider;
* a definite refusal (bad key, invalid request) is fatal immediately: no
  retry could turn a 401 into a conversion.

Captions and chart digitization stay off. Both have been measured producing
confident wrong content, and a translation would then carry it.
